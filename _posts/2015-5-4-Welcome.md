I am now working at [Dept. of Industrial & Manegement Engineering](heep://ime.hufs.ac.kr), [Hankuk University of Foreign Studies](http://www.hufs.ac.kr) as an assistant professor. 

My main research interest is to analyse, model, design, and implement algorithms for optimization problems by using in-depth theory and the state-of-the-art tools. 

You can download my [CV](/cv.pdf).

###Some facts about me:

- My Erdös number is 4 (Paul Erdös -> Craig A. Tovey -> George L. Nemhauser -> Sungsoo Park -> Me!). You can calculate your own at [here](http://www.oakland.edu/enp/). I bet it will be much smaller than you may think!
- I am very enjoying collaborations with researchers from other fields. If any optimization issues come up in your research, you may contact me!
- You can see citation statistics of my papers at [here](http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OLXPtxgAAAAJ).
