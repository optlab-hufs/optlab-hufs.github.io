> Thesis : Robust optimization models and algorithms for the problems in telecommunications and logistics.

> Brief summary : Several optimization problems in the telecommunication network and logistics subject to data uncertainty are considered. To handle the uncertainty of data efficiently, the robust optimization methodology is adopted, where the goal is to obtain a solution which is feasible for all possible realizations of input data. Formulations of the problems and exact solution algorithms for the robust solution are proposed.
